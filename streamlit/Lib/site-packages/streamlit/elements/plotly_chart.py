    The schema for the Plotly chart selection state.

    The selection state is stored in a dictionary-like object that supports both
    key and attribute notation. Selection states cannot be programmatically
    changed or set through Session State.

    Attributes
    ----------
    points : list[dict[str, Any]]
        The selected data points in the chart, including the data points
        selected by the box and lasso mode. The data includes the values
        associated to each point and a point index used to populate
        ``point_indices``. If additional information has been assigned to your
        points, such as size or legend group, this is also included.

    point_indices : list[int]
        The numerical indices of all selected data points in the chart. The
        details of each identified point are included in ``points``.

    box : list[dict[str, Any]]
        The metadata related to the box selection. This includes the
        coordinates of the selected area.

    lasso : list[dict[str, Any]]
        The metadata related to the lasso selection. This includes the
        coordinates of the selected area.

    Example
    -------
    When working with more complicated graphs, the ``points`` attribute
    displays additional information. Try selecting points in the following
    example:

    >>> import plotly.express as px
    >>> import streamlit as st
    >>>
    >>> df = px.data.iris()
    >>> fig = px.scatter(
    ...     df,

    ...     color="species",
    ...     size="petal_length",

    >>>
    >>> event = st.plotly_chart(fig, key="iris", on_select="rerun")

    >>> event.selection

        """Display an interactive Plotly chart.

        `Plotly <https://plot.ly/python>`_ is a charting library for Python.
        The arguments to this function closely follow the ones for Plotly's
        ``plot()`` function.

        To show Plotly charts in Streamlit, call ``st.plotly_chart`` wherever
        you would call Plotly's ``py.plot`` or ``py.iplot``.

        .. Important::
            You must install ``plotly>=4.0.0`` to use this command. Your app's
            performance may be enhanced by installing ``orjson`` as well. You
            can install all charting dependencies (except Bokeh) as an extra
            with Streamlit:

            .. code-block:: shell

               pip install streamlit[charts]

        Parameters
        ----------
        figure_or_data : plotly.graph_objs.Figure, plotly.graph_objs.Data,\
            or dict/list of plotly.graph_objs.Figure/Data

            The Plotly ``Figure`` or ``Data`` object to render. See
            https://plot.ly/python/ for examples of graph descriptions.

            .. note::
                If your chart contains more than 1000 data points, Plotly will
                use a WebGL renderer to display the chart. Different browsers
                have different limits on the number of WebGL contexts per page.
                If you have multiple WebGL contexts on a page, you may need to
                switch to SVG rendering mode. You can do this by setting
                ``render_mode="svg"`` within the figure. For example, the
                following code defines a Plotly Express line chart that will
                render in SVG mode when passed to ``st.plotly_chart``:
                ``px.line(df, x="x", y="y", render_mode="svg")``.

        use_container_width : bool
            Whether to override the figure's native width with the width of
            the parent container. If ``use_container_width`` is ``True`` (default),
            Streamlit sets the width of the figure to match the width of the parent
            container. If ``use_container_width`` is ``False``, Streamlit sets the
            width of the chart to fit its contents according to the plotting library,
            up to the width of the parent container.

        theme : "streamlit" or None
            The theme of the chart. If ``theme`` is ``"streamlit"`` (default),
            Streamlit uses its own design default. If ``theme`` is ``None``,
            Streamlit falls back to the default behavior of the library.

            The ``"streamlit"`` theme can be partially customized through the
            configuration options ``theme.chartCategoricalColors`` and
            ``theme.chartSequentialColors``. Font configuration options are
            also applied.

        key : str
            An optional string to use for giving this element a stable
            identity. If ``key`` is ``None`` (default), this element's identity
            will be determined based on the values of the other parameters.

            Additionally, if selections are activated and ``key`` is provided,
            Streamlit will register the key in Session State to store the
            selection state. The selection state is read-only.

        on_select : "ignore" or "rerun" or callable
            How the figure should respond to user selection events. This
            controls whether or not the figure behaves like an input widget.
            ``on_select`` can be one of the following:

            - ``"ignore"`` (default): Streamlit will not react to any selection
              events in the chart. The figure will not behave like an input
              widget.

            - ``"rerun"``: Streamlit will rerun the app when the user selects
              data in the chart. In this case, ``st.plotly_chart`` will return
              the selection data as a dictionary.

            - A ``callable``: Streamlit will rerun the app and execute the
              ``callable`` as a callback function before the rest of the app.
              In this case, ``st.plotly_chart`` will return the selection data
              as a dictionary.

        selection_mode : "points", "box", "lasso" or an Iterable of these
            The selection mode of the chart. This can be one of the following:

            - ``"points"``: The chart will allow selections based on individual
              data points.
            - ``"box"``: The chart will allow selections based on rectangular
              areas.
            - ``"lasso"``: The chart will allow selections based on freeform
              areas.
            - An ``Iterable`` of the above options: The chart will allow
              selections based on the modes specified.

            All selections modes are activated by default.

        config : dict or None
            A dictionary of Plotly configuration options. This is passed to
            Plotly's ``show()`` function. For more information about Plotly
            configuration options, see Plotly's documentation on `Configuration
            in Python <https://plotly.com/python/configuration-options/>`_.

        **kwargs
            Additional arguments accepted by Plotly's ``plot()`` function.

            This supports ``config``, a dictionary of Plotly configuration
            options. For more information about Plotly configuration options,
            see Plotly's documentation on `Configuration in Python
            <https://plotly.com/python/configuration-options/>`_.

            .. deprecated::
               ``**kwargs`` are deprecated and will be removed in a future
               release. Use ``config`` instead.

        Returns
        -------
        element or dict
            If ``on_select`` is ``"ignore"`` (default), this command returns an
            internal placeholder for the chart element. Otherwise, this command
            returns a dictionary-like object that supports both key and
            attribute notation. The attributes are described by the
            ``PlotlyState`` dictionary schema.

        Examples
        --------
        **Example 1: Basic Plotly chart**

        The example below comes from the examples at https://plot.ly/python.
        Note that ``plotly.figure_factory`` requires ``scipy`` to run.

        >>> import plotly.figure_factory as ff
        >>> import streamlit as st
        >>> from numpy.random import default_rng as rng
        >>>

        ...     rng(1).standard_normal(200),
        ...     rng(2).standard_normal(200) + 2,
        ... ]
        >>> group_labels = ["Group 1", "Group 2", "Group 3"]
        >>>
        >>> fig = ff.create_distplot(
        ...     hist_data, group_labels, bin_size=[0.1, 0.25, 0.5]
        ... )
        >>>
        >>> st.plotly_chart(fig)

           height: 550px

        **Example 2: Plotly Chart with configuration**

        By default, Plotly charts have scroll zoom enabled. If you have a
        longer page and want to avoid conflicts between page scrolling and
        zooming, you can use Plotly's configuration options to disable scroll
        zoom. In the following example, scroll zoom is disabled, but the zoom
        buttons are still enabled in the modebar.

        >>> import plotly.graph_objects as go
        >>> import streamlit as st
        >>>
        >>> fig = go.Figure()
        >>> fig.add_trace(
        ...     go.Scatter(
        ...         x=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
        ...         y=[1, 3, 2, 5, 4]
        ...     )
        ... )
        >>>
        >>> st.plotly_chart(fig, config = {'scrollZoom': False})

        .. output::
